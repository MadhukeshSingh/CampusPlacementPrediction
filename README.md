# Campus Placement Prediction 

## Description

The Placement of students is one of the most important objective of an educational 
institution. Reputation and yearly admissions of an institution invariably depend on the 
placements it provides it students with. That is why all the institutions, arduously, strive 
to strengthen their placement department so as to improve their institution on a whole. 
Any assistance in this particular area will have a positive impact on an institution‚Äôs ability 
to place its students. This will always be helpful to both the students, as well as the 
institution.
